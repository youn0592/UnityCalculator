BUGLIST: 


TESTING:


SOLVED BUGS:

*** Current Number is not Resetting after hitting an operation.
*** When running a previous opperate, Percent is overriding and causing a bug.
*** Hitting decimal while current number is 0 causes the number to break
*** When adding an exponent, the calculator casues a bug where it just resets to 0.
*** Decimal opperation no longer working as intended.
*** Currently, hitting the same opperation twice without changing the number will cause the calc to run again
	Fine for Addition and Subtraction as no change when num + 0, however, massive problem with * and / 
	having a number be * by 0 breaks the equation
